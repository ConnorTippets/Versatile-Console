#Versatile Console 1.2 Changelog
##Added:
	###MAJOR:
		Added a GUI!
	###MINOR:
		Add cls/clear command to clear output

##How to use the GUI
At the bottom, there is a textbox where you type your commands.\
After typing your command, press enter.\
The command output is displayed just above the textbox.

###Minor Note
In order to clear the textbox, it uses the keyboard module to CTRL+A+Backspace
That might sound bad, but this runs super super fast and you can't really switch to anything else within a fraction of a second.
